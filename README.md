# Distributed System Module
A liteweight distributed System Middleware designed to be crash fault tolerant.

## Notes: Features until the moment,
1. It is working just with threads simulating hosts;
2. It is detecting crashed threads;
3. It shows up threads alive in a table on the screen.

## Work in progress,
1. Improve the information on the screen (i.e add the column "is alive");
2. Correct the manner the timestamp is collected;
3. Decide about a leader on group even if the actual leader crashes.
